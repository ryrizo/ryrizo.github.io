Hi, I'm Ryan Perrizo. I'm a technologist with a wide breadth of experience from software engineering, to machine learning, to cybersecurity. I love to reading, writing, chess, and kettlebells. My collection of notes over the years has been incredibly beneficial to me. I realized I wanted a mechanism for sharing, which you are looking at. I hope I write something you find helpful.
